# Process Control Boards and Process Creation and Termination

# Process Review
---

## Manage multiple processes
- information about each process must be maintained
  - Process control block used for this
    - Process ID
    - Process State
    - Program Counter - address of next instruction to be executed
    - Registers - general purpose registers, stack pointers, etc
    - Scheduling information
    - Memory management information
    - Accounting information - time limits, etc 

---
## Unix process creation (fork)
- Process invokes fork to initiate creation of new process
- Creating process is parent and new process is child
- System call creates new process
- Data from parent copied to child
  - Memory image, environment settings I/O handles, etc
  - Of course child get its own ID, scheduling info etc

---
## Fork()
- fork call returns a value
  - Upon success, fork returns child ID to parent
  - ... returns 0 to child

- Parent/chihld process independently continue exeuction from statement after fork

If process spwan fails, fork returns -1 to parent & no child is created

```c++
pid_t id = fork();
if(id == -1){
  cout << "Error creating process\n";
} else if (id == 0) {
  cout << "I'm a child process!\n";
} else {
  cout << "I just became a parent!\n";
}
```
---
## EXEC System call
- Child can change the program it executes
- Invove exec family of system calls to change its memory image
- Stops executing code in parent program & starts new program

```c++
pid_t id = fork();
if(id == -1){
  cout << "Error creating process\n";
} else if (id == 0){
  // child process functionality
  char* args[] = {"echo", "hello", NULL};
  execvp(args[0], args);
} else {
  cout << "I just became a parent!\n";
}
```

## CLion Example - Processes.cpp

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <unistd.h>

void fork_example();

int main() {
    pid_t id = fork();
    if(id == -1) {
        std::cout << "Error creating process\n";
    }
    else if (id == 0) {
        // child process functionality
        char* args[] = {(char *) "echo", (char *) "Hello,", (char *) " World!", NULL};
        execvp(args[0], args);
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "I just became a parent!\n";
        int status;
        waitpid(id, &status, 0);
    }

    //fork_example();
    return 0;
}

void fork_example() {

    //fork() returns 0 to the child and the child's ID to the parent
    //Recap truthy and falsey
    if (fork ()) {
        fork ();
    } else {
        std::cout << "Hello";
    }
}

## Looking deeper into processes
- Process embodies two primary characterisitics
  - Resource ownership
  - Execution of a sequence of instrutions
    - This characteristic is captured by abstration called thread
  - Process provides environment and resources for thread execution

- Process could contain multiple instruction sequences
- Sequences can be modeled as threads in single process
  - Allows concurrency within single process

- Word processor
  - Thread to interface with user
  - Thread to reformat document in the background
  - Thread to perform auto save

- Web server
  - Dispatcher thread listens for requests on given connection
  - Requests serviced by different worker thread

---
## Thread states
- Similar to processes, threads also can be in different states
  - States and transitions are similar to processes

---
## What info is per-thread
- Program counter
- Stack and stack pointer
- Registers

---
## Thread Info
- Just like PCBs are used for processes
- ... Thread Control Blocks are used to maintain info

---
# **Important points to note**

- Proccess -> instance of single program owned by single user
- OS provides no protection among threads of same process
  - Assumption threads within process cooperate, not compete
- All thread specific data (TCBs & stacks for all threads)
  - Part of process memory image...
  - â€¦and hence accessible to all threads
- Programs must be carefully designed & implemented to ensure correctness
- Every process has at least one thread of execution (e.g., main)
  - Processes start with this one default thread
  - This thread can create other threads, which can create more,

---
## Advantages of multi-threading
- More efficient CPU utilization within process
- Creation/termination of threads is cheap
- Context switch time between threads of process is minimal
  - only info exclusive to threads needs to be "switched"
- Supports effective communication due to shared memory
